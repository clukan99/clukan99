- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @clukan99. I am a pharmacy student at Butler university. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science and its applications to healthcare, pharmacy, bioinformatics and chemistry.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI/ML techniques through classes and individual projects. 

One of my larger projects include contributions to the ATOM data repository by creating a chemical feature importance algorithm. My commit does not show since I had to indiviudually email it to an administrator. 

Additional AI/ML projects can be found under colts_project_final. This includes SVM, RF, and ANN model written with the sklearn and pytorch packages. The ANN model with 1 layer received 1st place in the undergraduate competition and 4th place in the graduate division (this was based on accuracy and I competed in the undergrad division). 

I have bioinformatics work that is not included on this repository since the files of genomic data were too large. However, you can see my contributions to the Shiny nano tube website -- This was also published in the bioinformatics journal. 

My course work is posted under the names CS151, DS110, and caidens_candy_database. I have turned the DS110 from R into python in the DS110_python repository for my professor.
